How to run in your system.
I have divide it into two parts.
one is frontEnd and another is backend.

In order to run it you have to run the server differently but at the same time.

1. For backend you have to write the command like
   cd backEnd
   npm install
   node app.js

1. For frontend first enter
   cd frontEnd,
   cd eqaim
   npm install
   Npm start
